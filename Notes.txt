Ideas for future extensebility of this app which could demonstrate the value of unit tests and high cohesion/low coupling:

1) Convert this to a manager/engine/accessor format
2) Add the following capabilities to the thermostat: 
	Humidifier
	Air conditioner
	Notifications to smart phones
	Remote control of min/max temp
